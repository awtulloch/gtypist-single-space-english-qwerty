B:                             Lesson Q1

*:_Q_R_L0
T:			Welcome to lesson Q1.
 :
 :In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard. I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient. Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice. Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing. This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later. If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know. (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking. Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways. It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly. Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

*:_Q_R_L1
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are. The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key. Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar. (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.) Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys. Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key. This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Above the D-key is the E-key. Above the K-key is the I-key. Learn these
 :positions well. Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
 :make sure they are in the HOME position. Then don't look at them again.

*:_Q_R_L2
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen. If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything. If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key. To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key. Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position. Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process. Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern. If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again. If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc. Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

 :
 :In this lesson you learn six new letters (H, G, O, U, N, T) and the period. (.).
 :Be sure that the F-finger does not linger on the G-key or the J-finger on the
 :H-key. Also be sure to use your fingers as follows:
 :
 : 'f' for 't' and 'g', 'j' for 'h', 'u' and 'n', finally use 'l' for 'o' and '.'
 :
 :Note that a period is followed by one space because it's no longer 1957.

 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running. When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM). I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).

S:Dear Ted,
 :
 :A day ago Ann got a bad cut on her arm and a few by her
 :eye and ear. It is an act of God she did not die. Her car
 :did the job. It is the end of her car. She has no use for a
 :car. The fee is to be big. She is in bed, but she can not
 :eat. She can not eat a bit of egg. It is no fun at all.
 :
 :It is hot. It is too hot for her fur hat, but I can buy
 :a box for it. I am due any day. I can cut a day if I fly.
 :It is not far if I go by air. If I go by car, I add a day.
 :
 :How is Dan? Did he get his job? Dan had to beg for it
 :if he did. He is big and fat but not bad. The boy can do
 :it if he can act to fit his age. Ask him not to act as a kid.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(9) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L30
S:To tell this class all there is to learn is not a real
 :help later. Let the class plan the loose ease that can hold
 :each hand in place, or plan to end this or that poor slip,
 :or plan to do its total lines in less hours. As a rule, to
 :plan and to do are also to learn. The class plans to drop
 :the old action to clear the road. Those old slips are lost.
 :The class has large plans; gains in hours and less slips.

 :If 5 feet and 7 inches, he may weigh 136; if 5 feet and 9
 :inches, 144; if 5 feet and 10 inches, he may weigh 148. Now
 :add 5 pounds for each added inch. Thus to stand 6 feet tall

B:                            Lesson T1

*:_T_R_L0
T:			Welcome to lesson T1.
 :
 :In the T series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard. I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient. Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice. Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing. This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later. If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know. (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking. Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways. It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly. Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

*:_T_R_L1
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are. The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key. Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar. (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.) Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys. Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key. This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Learn these positions well. Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your
 :fingers and make sure they are in the HOME position. Then don't look at them
 :again.

*:_T_R_L2
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen. If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything. If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and 
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key. To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key. Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position. Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process. Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern. If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again. If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc. Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

I:Hit the F-key four times with the first finger of your left hand.

 :and will add the letters E, G, and H and the period.
 :
 :When you reach for any of these keys, be sure to return your finger to its
 :home position. For example, to hit the H-key, move the first finger of your
 :right hand (the J-finger) slightly to the left. Tap the H-key and immediately
 :bring your finger back over the J.

T:			SPEED EXERCISES
 :
 :From now on, I will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons. In the
 :drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
 :you get it right. In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.
 :
 :What will be different is that I will be timing you. From the time you type
 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running. When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM). I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
 :Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

I:Try this sentence:
*:_T_R_L77
S:Sarah has liked knitting all her life.

I:Try a little longer sentence.
*:_T_R_L78
S:She looked past her garden to the fields and longed to see the other side.

I:When you type a multi-line paragraph, you will have to hit the RETURN-key at
 :the end of each line.
*:_T_R_L79
S:All the sane people in this area sold their gold
 :right at the start. The insane ones held their
 :gold and later it paid off.

*:_T_R_L80
S:One fine afternoon the king had an idea. He
 :sent a letter to all the lords and ladies of
 :his land. He asked for a great feast. His
 :people prepared roasts. His jester did a jig.
 :All the people left hoping to do it again.

 :			NUMERIC KEYS
 :
 :The terminal has two sets of numeric keys. One set--directly above the
 :alphabetic keys--conforms to the standard for typewriter keyboards. The other
 :set--to your right--resembles a calculator keypad. In this typing series we
 :will be concerned only with the standard numeric keys on the main keyboard.
 :(If you would like to learn to touch type on a numeric keypad, use the N-series
 :lessons instead.)
 :
 :NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad
 :
 :The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on, vary
 :somewhat from machine to machine. The 2 through 0 keys are always in exactly
 :the same place on all typewriter keyboards. (On keypunch machines and some
 :terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J, K, L, M, comma and
 :period keys. We will not be concerned with these layouts in this series.)
 :Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not
 :have a 1 key. If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2. If it does not,
 :you will have to use the L-key.

I:Let's start by using the 1-key, since we have one. (Use your A-finger.)

T:
 :In this lesson we will be practicing the shifted numeric keys on the
 :terminal keyboard. I will only be giving you practice in the keystroke
 :motions. Very few sentence drills or speed exercises are included, since these
 :keys are used so infrequently.
 :
 :If you are typing something which includes one of these special characters and
 :you cannot remember where a key is, look. But, always make sure to hit the key
 :with the correct finger. (If you do use the key often, you will eventually
 :learn where it is without looking.) Since these keys are used infrequently and
 :are in different places on most other keyboards or are totally missing, speed
 :is not important.

I:Use your S-finger for the at-sign.

T:				THE END
 :
 :You have now completed the T-series of these lessons. If you have not already
 :done so, you should now start the N-series or S-series.
 :
 :There are a few keys which we have not studied. If you decide to touch-type
 :these keys, use the closest finger. Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
 :keys use the A-finger. And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
 :FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger. The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
 :not usually touch typed as the reach is too far. If you can, fine.
 :
 :The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
 :the SHIFT keys whenever possible. For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
 :hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
 :finger. Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
 :Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
 :the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
 :case).

D:To learn to typewrite is not difficult. The keyboard
 :of the typewriter may be mastered in a few hours, but to
 :get speed in typewriting calls for a good deal of practice.

 :selection over and over again until it can be written easily

 :such cost in his selling price, he is unlikely to show a profit.

I:(4)

S:Character shows itself in a man's conduct. Deeds speak
 :louder than words. Words sometimes confuse as issue where
 :deeds clarify it. The test of a man's sincerity is not what
 :he says but what he does. Consider this well and you will
 :never be confused in estimating a man's worth.

*:_U_R_L55
S:Concentration is a valuable faculty. The ability to direct
 :one's attention exclusively along certain lines accounts for
 :the success of some people. Diffusion of effort is considered
 :an enemy of success. We are told that this is an age of
 :specialisation, and specialisation demands concentration.

 :A business letter should not be a literary masterpiece, but
 :that is not to say that it should not have style.

 :
 :I am placing your name on our mailing list for all future
 :reports sent out by the company, and if at any time you have

 :will advise me, I shall be happy to give you any additional
 :information that I may have.
 :
 :Very truly yours,

I:(6)
*:_U_R_L67
S:Strive for typing accuracy. Speed without accuracy is of little value.
 :Rhythm is the secret of typing skill. Don't write one part of a word
 :faster than another. Slow down so that you can maintain a regular rhythm.
 :
 :Think of the letters before you strike them. Strike the keys evenly, so
 :that the printing impression does not vary. At the same time, try to
 :develop your stroking speed and make it a habit to release the keys quickly.
 :To get up speed, type each exercise three or four times.
 :
 :To do your best, it is necessary that you be relaxed. You may be trying so
 :hard that you are all tied up in knots. Relax consciously. If you have a
 :feeling of tenseness and hurry, you are not properly relaxed.

D:If you can do so, will you kindly let us know by return mail.

I:(2) Continuous Copy
*:_M_R_L1
D:My totals were: $2,309, $5,687, $3,498, $2,408, and $3,697.

I:(3)
*:_M_R_L2
D:A student may type 1 word per minute faster for each added
 :year of age: i.e., 13 to 14, to 15, to 16, to 17, to 18.

I:(4)
*:_M_R_L3
D:Often 25% of first-year students never do 25 words a minute.
 :Many second-year students can type about 45 words a minute.
 :More than 50% do not equal the practical rate of 50 words.

I:(5)
*:_M_R_L4
D:Why do we all thrill over sports? Maybe it is the tireless
 :skill of the winner that we feel. Ask the players. They
 :may agree (Rice,* famous as a sports writer, said the cham-
 :pions all agreed) that skill is only part (50%) of it.

I:(6)
*:_M_R_L5
D:"When you step on the first tee," says the four-time gold
 :champion, Bobby Jones, "you know you can't afford to make
 :one careless slip." A tired Bobby Jones (this was the way
 :Bobby told it to Rice) has stood on the 16th tee, leading
 :Smith by 18 strokes.

I:(7)
*:_M_R_L6
D:"Up to this point," says Bobby, "I had played 33 holes in 11
 :under par. I believe it was the best golf I ever played in
 :my life. But after easing up on the mental side I played
 :the last three holes in 5 over par."

I:(8)
*:_M_R_L7
D:In 1919 Babe Ruth shot into the records with 29 home runs.
 :Yet few know that the Babe worked five years in big games
 :before this start that led past Home Run #600. You may
 :have cheered Jimmy Foxx and many another. Yet you can still
 :picture the Babe after two strikes, smashing to the very
 :spot he had "called" a famous home run.

I:(9)
*:_M_R_L8
D:It is the effort against odds that thrills. We feel these
 :drives that never let down. We feel (this was the way Rice
 :put it) the champion forces himself into the winning frame of
 :mind. Can the fast typist afford to do less? A typist has
 :to face such days of "mental torture" too. Some days he has
 :to force himself along. He need not punish his machine. He
 :must pull himself together (100%) to type his steady, smooth
 :way over all upsets.

I:(9A) Pointed Paragraph (m b)
*:_M_R_L9
S:Men are bound to believe that business is bad in winter
 :months. Maybe Mr. Smith remembers that most building became
 :better in September but both November and December seemed to
 :be much behind. Monday morning my mail box became blocked
 :by urgent requests of many families that small-sized homes
 :be built. Some jobs may begin to come now from the Chamber
 :of Commerce members.

I:(10) Rhythmic Review
*:_M_R_L10

 :The city has been busy but cold for two days. Dear baby

S:Dear Bea,
 :
 :I am glad you feel so for the farm in the East. Even
 :as a girl of four or five I was ever so glad to find the
 :farm. In my eyes it was all as good as gold. Even my feet
 :felt good. A girl can gain and grow fast on farm food and
 :the fine free air. Why else did face and form grow full
 :and fair so fast?
 :
 :On each foot of my farm I felt free from fear. It
 :gave me my fill of fun. I felt no fear of any fire in the
 :fall. Now the fire is a fact and my farm is gone. Give me
 :my full life, etc. The game goes on.

S:Dear Hal,

 :Just a line to say I am lost if I cannot fly. I
 :have to keep on here. I knew it was but a hope last May.
 :It was just my last idea in June. Yet I held my head high
 :and did not lose hope.
 :
 :Why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
 :look at my lake and our home on the hill? I left it late
 :last July with one item on my list. Bill gave me half an
 :hour of help. Like the lady of the lake I met the king.
 :Bill was a kind king, too.
 :
 :To lead off into the air and see all our lake so
 :long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour. I
 :kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear. In the air my
 :hair was a loss. It did not kill me. I have to fly to know
 :life can be less hard. I like to hold on and help Bill. I
 :love to fly.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

 :
 :I have your two later notes of March 1. Maybe it is a

 :March.
 :
 :Our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
 :sic means much to us. A night of music, even one piece of
 :music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
 :the power I have known. If I can plant a love of music in all
 :parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
 :love it, it will mean more to me than money.
 :
 :I never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
 :lines that price ought to be the least of all the items? The
 :point is that our plans for your party are more important. If
 :you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,

 :under the small shade tree. She does not quote the boy, but does

S:Dear Sir,
 :
 :I wish to acknowledge the recent interesting correspondence
 :from your office on the very considerable requirements of the new
 :law that have to do with any unfortunate advertising that might
 :appear in my papers.
 :
 :Our association also has appreciated both your instructions
 :and the opportunity for prompt examination and understanding of
 :the new arrangement, particularly its application to all informa-
 :tion given the public about merchandise for sale. This has been
 :a real convenience in our consideration of the entire proposition.
 :
 :I want to assure you that our co-operation under the new law
 :will be satisfactory in every way.
 :
 :Yours respectfully,

S:The JOURNAL learned that the relatives on their arrival in
 :April had already referred the trouble to lawyers. Their early re-
 :turn surprises me. As to the children themselves, the older girls
 :are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest. They
 :travel yearly and already are familiar with the world. Their father
 :was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them. His will leaves
 :them very nearly a half-million dollars. Only the earlier, first
 :will is very irregular. I've already quizzed them about the real
 :hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size. From their
 :replies I've realised slowly that the girls are all right. It
 :really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
 :upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
 :should be recognised easily as false.

T:			SPEED PRACTICE SERIES
 :
 :The S series of lessons is designed to help you improve your typing speed
 :and accuracy. It is assumed that you have already learned how to touch
 :type either from a previous course in touch typing or from the T series of
 :these lessons.
 :
 :You can use this series even if you do not know how to touch type. But, it is
 :recommended that you at least learn to touch type most of the letters of the
 :alphabet before starting this series. When you encounter a letter or symbol
 :which you have not learned, you will have to look. This is a very bad habit to
 :get into and is hard to break. (You needn't worry if you only need to glance
 :down for unusual keys, like the dollar sign.)

*:_S_R_L1
T:			   RULES OF THE GAME
 :
 :I will display a paragraph on the screen. You should then type the entire
 :paragraph as quickly and as accurately as possible.  As you type each
 :character, I will immediately check it for accuracy. If it was right, I won't
 :do anything. But, if you made a mistake, I will beep and write that letter in
 :inverse video (a black character on a white background). You can ignore the
 :error and continue going; or, you can backup and correct it with the DELETE
 :or BACKSPACE keys. (I will still count it as an error though.)
 :
 :I will also be timing you. From the time you type the first character until
 :you hit the final carriage return, my stop watch will be going. At the
 :end of the paragraph, I will tell you your rating (in words-per-minute).
 :
 :If you made too many mistakes, try the next paragraph slower. If you made no
 :mistakes or only one or two, try the next one faster.

I:First, a quick warm-up.
*:_S_R_L2
S:The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.

I:Once more:
*:_S_R_L3
S:The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.

I:If the cursor is on a blank line, type return to skip it

S:Dear Sirs:
 :
 :I have just purchased a Heathkit H89 computer system and would
 :like to order two boxes of diskettes for it. This system uses
 :5 1/4 inch, hard-sectored, ten-sector, single-sided, single-
 :density diskettes.
 :
 :Enclosed is my check for $45.00. Please rush this order, as I
 :can not use my system before they arrive.
 :
 :Sincerely,
 :
 :Mr. Smith

*:_S_R_L5
S:Dear Sirs:
 :
 :Thank you for sending the diskettes so promptly. How-
 :ever, the diskettes which you sent are for soft-sectored
 :drives. As I stated in my original letter my system
 :accepts only ten-sector, hard-sectored diskettes.
 :
 :I will return these two boxes as soon as I receive the
 :correct ones.
 :
 :Sincerely,
 :
 :Mr. Smith

*:_S_R_L6
S:Dear Mr. Smith:
 :
 :Thank you for informing us that the diskettes which you pur-
 :chased from us are not satisfactory. We are sorry for the
 :inconvenience you have been caused in this transaction.
 :
 :We shall be glad to replace the diskettes you now have or to
 :allow you to select a different brand. If you will let us know
 :your wishes we shall be glad to give the matter our immediate
 :attention.
 :
 :We hope you will give us the opportunity to prove to you that
 :this incident is most unusual and that we do strive to render
 :to our customers an efficient and courteous service at all
 :times.

 :so famous) people.

I:Marcus Aurelius
*:_S_R_L8
S:A man can live well even in a palace.

I:Ralph Waldo Emerson
*:_S_R_L9
S:My chief want in life is someone who shall make me do what I can.

I:Elizabeth Barrett Browning
*:_S_R_L10
S:No man can be called friendless when he has God and the
 :companionship of good books.

I:Ralph Waldo Emerson
*:_S_R_L11
S:I like the silent church before the service begins better than any preaching.

I:George Washington
*:_S_R_L12
S:True friendship is a plant of slow growth.

I:Aristotle
*:_S_R_L13
S:There is a foolish corner in the brain of the wisest men.

I:Goethe
*:_S_R_L14
S:Tell me what you are busy about, and I will tell you what you are.

I:Gelett Burgess
*:_S_R_L15
S:If in the last few years you haven't discarded a major opinion or
 :acquired a new one, check your pulse. You may be dead.

I:James B. Conant
*:_S_R_L16
S:Democracy is a small hard core of common agreement, surrounded
 :by a rich variety of individual differences.

I:Albert Einstein
*:_S_R_L17
S:I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.

I:Harry S. Truman
*:_S_R_L18
S:Men often mistake notoriety for fame, and would rather be
 :remarked for their vices than not be noticed at all.

I:Will Rogers
*:_S_R_L19
S:I could study all my life and not think up half the amount
 :of funny things they can think of in one session of Congress.

I:Ralph Waldo Emerson
*:_S_R_L20
S:Hospitality consists in a little fire, a little food and an immense quiet.

I:H. L. Mencken
*:_S_R_L21
S:Puritanism is the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy.

I:William James
*:_S_R_L22
S:When you have to make a choice and don't make it, that is in itself a choice.

I:James Holt McGravran.
*:_S_R_L23
S:There is a way of transferring funds that is even faster
 :than electronic banking. It is called marriage.

I:Woody Allen
*:_S_R_L24
S:Showing up is 80 percent of life.

I:Robert Frost
*:_S_R_L25
S:A poem begins in delight and ends in wisdom.

I:Louis Pasteur

*:_S_R_L27
T:
 :In this lesson you will be given several excerpts from the classics.
 :Take your time and type them carefully.

I:A Christmas Carol, Stave One, Marley's Ghost
*:_S_R_L28
S:Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all par-
 :ticular about the knocker on the door, except that it
 :was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
 :seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
 :in that place; also that Scrooge has as little of what
 :is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
 :London, even including--which is a bold word--the
 :corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be
 :borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
 :thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
 :seven year's dead partner that afternoon. And then
 :let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
 :that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
 :saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any inter-
 :mediate process of change--not a knocker, but Mar-
 :ley's face.

I:Gulliver's Travels, Chapter One, A Voyage to Lilliput
*:_S_R_L29
S:When I awaked it was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but I
 :found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
 :the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
 :ground in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender
 :ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs. I
 :could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
 :light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me;
 :but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky. In a
 :little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
 :which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
 :to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
 :perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
 :bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the
 :mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
 :conjectured) following the first.

I:Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
*:_S_R_L30
S:I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that
 :I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before,
 :and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous
 :position. Some of the man's money--if he had any--was
 :certainly due to us; but it was not likely that our
 :captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by
 :me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to
 :give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.
 :The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Dr.
 :Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected,
 :which was not to be thought of. Indeed, it seemed
 :impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the
 :house: the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very
 :ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.

I:Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
*:_S_R_L31
S:The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
 :approaching footsteps; and what between the dead
 :body of the captain on the parlor floor, and the thought
 :of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand,
 :and ready to return, there were moments when, as the
 :saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror. Something
 :must speedily be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at
 :last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbour-
 :ing hamlet. No sooner said than done. Bareheaded as we
 :were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
 :the frosty fog.

 :In this lesson you will be given several soliloquies from
 :Shakespeare's plays. The spelling and punctuation are
 :quite hard. Take your time and type them carefully.

I:Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II (Capulet's Garden).
*:_S_R_L33
S:But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
 :It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
 :Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
 :Who is already sick and pale with grief,
 :That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
 :Be not her maid, since she is envious;
 :Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
 :And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
 :It is my lady; O, it is my love!
 :O, that she knew she were!--
 :She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
 :Her eye discourses, I will answer it.--
 :I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:

*:_S_R_L34
S:Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
 :Having some business, do entreat her eyes
 :To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
 :What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
 :The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
 :As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
 :Would through the airy region stream so bright
 :That birds would sing, and think it were not night.--
 :See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
 :O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
 :That I might touch that cheek!

I:Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene II (The Forum).
*:_S_R_L35
S:Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
 :I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
 :The evil that men do lives after them;
 :The good is oft interred with their bones;
 :So let it be with Caesar: The noble Brutus
 :Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
 :If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
 :And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
 :Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
 :For Brutus is an honourable man;
 :So are they all, all honourable men,--
 :Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
 :He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
 :But Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.

*:_S_R_L36
S:He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
 :Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
 :Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
 :When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
 :Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.
 :You all did see that on the Lupercal
 :I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
 :Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And, sure, he is an honourable man.

*:_S_R_L37
S:I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
 :But here I am to speak what I do know.
 :You all did love him once,--not without cause:
 :What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
 :O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
 :And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
 :My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
 :And I must pause till it come back to me.

I:The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I (A Court of Justice).
*:_S_R_L38
S:The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
 :It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 :Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
 :It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
 :'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
 :The throned monarch better than his crown;
 :His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
 :The attribute to awe and majesty,
 :Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;

*:_S_R_L39
S:But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,--
 :It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
 :It is an attribute to God himself;
 :And earthly power doth then show likest God's
 :When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
 :Though justice be thy plea consider this--
 :That in the course of justice none of us
 :Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
 :And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 :The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
 :To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
 :Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
 :Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

 :			Numeric Keypad Lessons
 :
 :The N series lessons are provided for practice with the numeric keys available
 :on the H89/H19 terminal. You do not need to know how to touch type on the
 :standard keyboard in order to learn touch typing on a calculator keypad. So,
 :you can begin this series right away.
 :
 :When entering numeric values, accuracy is usually more important than speed.
 :Take these lessons very slowly. Speed will come naturally later.
 :
 :As with the standard keypad, you must start in the HOME position. Place the
 :first three fingers of your right hand over the 4, 5, and 6 keys of the keypad.
 :(Your thumb and fifth finger are not used.) Your fingers should be poised just
 :over the keys gently brushing them. Use the thumb or any finger of your left
 :hand for other keys, such as the SPACE bar.
 :
 :After entering each line, hit the ENTER key with the 6-finger (the third finger
 :of your right hand). Immediately return your finger to the 6 key. It is very
 :important that you bring the finger back without looking.

I:Use your third finger only.

# Lesson P1—Special Characters Review
*:SPECIAL_NUMS_REVIEW
B:Lesson P1
T:In the P series of lessons we work on special characters with an
 :emphasis on characters that are used when writing code in programming
 :or markup languages.
 :
 :We will start by reviewing the special characters that share keys with
 :the numerals on a standard US QWERTY keyboard: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ). If
 :you would like additional practice with these keys, please refer to the
 :T series of lessons in Gtypist.

I:(1) Warm up
D:The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
 :The sum of 1 and 2 is 3; the product of 6 and 9 is 54.

I:(2) Type the ! @ # $ % and ^ keys with your left hand
D:!!!! @@@@ #### $$$$ %%%% ^^^^
 :!@#$ #$%^ !!^^ %^%^ $$%% ##@!
 :^!%@ ##%% %$%$ @@^^ ##!! ^!$#

I:(3) Type the & * ( and ) keys with your right hand
D:&&&& **** (((( )))) &*() )(*&
 :(()) &&** *&*& (&&) (**) (())

I:(4) Practice with these characters
D:)!(@ #*$& %^%^ @@)) $$&& *$*$
 :(@@) ##)( %^%^ !#*& )!)! @*@*

I:(5) Try some sentences
S:It is hard to believe, but 230 minus 220 times one half equals 5!
 :(And 5!, of course, equals 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.)
 :
 :username@domainname.com is the #1 most common format for email addresses.
 :To convey Three Squared in numerals, some people write 3^2. But in some
 :programming languages, you should write 3 ** 2 instead.
 :The % symbol can have different meanings; it can mean percent, as in
 :(10% of 90) equals 9
 :or it can mean modulo, as in
 :10 % 9 equals 1
 :
 :The HTML entity for the & symbol is &amp;.

I:(6) And try our first bit of code
S:# Hello world in Python 2
 :print "Hello World!"
 :
 :
 :# Hello world in Python 3
 :print("Hello world!")
 :
 :
 :# Hello world in Ruby
 :puts "Hello World!"
 :
 :
 :;;; Hello world in Emacs Lisp
 :(defun hello-world()
 :  "Display the string hello world."
 :  (interactive)
 :  (message "Hello World!"))
 :
 :
 :" Hello world in Vim script
 ::echom "Hello World!"
 :
 :
 :# Hello world in SQL
 :SELECT 'Hello World!';
 :
 :
 :% Hello world in MATLAB
 :disp('Hello World!');

# Lesson P@—Special Characters Review, Pt 2
*:OTHER_PRIOR_SPECIAL_CHAR
B:Lesson P2
I:(1) Warm up/review
D:The! quick@ brown# fox$ jumps% over^ the& lazy* dog()
 :Buy 5 #2 pencils @ $0.99 each, but ask for a 15% discount for being a *friend*

I:(2) Hit the / and ? keys with the ; finger
D:;;;; //// ;;// ;/;/ //;; /;/;
 :;;;; ???? ;;?? ;?;? ??;; ?;?;
 :;;;; /?/? ;;/? ;/;? ?/;; ?;/;

I:(3) Hit the ' " and : keys with the ; finger
D:;;;; '''' ;;'' ;';' '';; ';';

 :;;;; """" ;;"" ;";" "";; ";";
 :;;;; :'"; "':; ";;" '::' :"":

I:(4) Practice these characters
D:;;;; /'?" "??" '//' ";;" '??'
 :;;?? "";; ::;; '':: '//' :"":

I:(5) Try some more sentences
S:What is your name? I hope it's "Bob": I've always liked the name "Bob".
 :
 :I've noticed that few gadgets have "on/off" switches these days. These days,
 :it's all "on/standby" or something! Why is that? Is "off" not good enough?

I:(6) And now a bit more "Hello world" coding
S:// Hello world in JavaScript
 :console.log("Hello World!");
 :
 :
 :// Hello world in Swift
 :println("Hello, World!")
 :
 :
 :# Hello world in Lua
 :print "Hello World!"
 :

 :--__ =_=_ ++__ -=_+ __++

I:(5) Practice these characters with other ;-finger characters
D:'__' +/-= "--" ::++ ?__?
 :;:;: -+-+ /++/ -_-_ ??++

I:(6) Try some sentences
S:The hyphen ("-") is used for compound words; the en dash,
 :which is longer than a hyphen, is used to indicate a range.
 :If you cannot use a true en dash, some people accept two
 :hyphens ("--") instead. The em dash is even longer than an
 :en dash, and is used to indicate a break in a sentence. If
 :you cannot use a true em dash, some people accept three
 :hyphens ("---") instead.
 :
 :If you cannot emphasize text by setting it in italic or by
 :underlining it, you can show emphasis with underscores ("like
 :_this_").

I:(7) And some programming/maths
S:int first_number = 7;
 :int second_number = 40;
 :int third_number = first_number + second_number - first_number;
 :
 :
 :1 + 2 + 8 + 12 - 74 = -51
 :
 :
 :for (let i = 0; i !== arr.length; i++)
 :
 :let a = 'string';
 :let b = 'string';
 :if (a === b) console.log('"a" and "b" are equal');
 :
 :
 :if ((10 / 10) === 5 % 4) console.log('Yep, that is how maths works');
